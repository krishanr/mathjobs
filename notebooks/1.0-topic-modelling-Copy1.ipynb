       "   these linear algebra objects become also random and create certain\n",
       "   statistics. The remarkable phenomenon is that most quantities become\n",
       "   independent of the chosen probability distribution when sending the\n",

Our advances will be motivated by the desire to enable autonomous cooperative systems in real-world applications. The project is well-supported by a number of industry partners. In the manufacturing sector, we have established collaborations with robotics manufacturers (Shadow Robots, Kinova and Inovo), a strategic partnership with the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (Robotic Systems for Smart Manufacturing Program) and with the HKUST Robotics Institute, amongst others.

Evidence of potential for excellence in research and good quality teaching is required. Review of applications will begin December 1, 2021, and will continue until the position is filled.\n",
       "\n",
       "In a departure from the past and to enhance the professional outcomes of our postdocs, we are conducting an open (not area-specific) search in which candidates will be ranked according to the quality of potential interactions with departmental faculty. Groups of at least two UTK Math faculty will “champion” individual applicants, and these applicants will then be ranked and offers made in descending order. Being the “champion” of a candidate requires the UTK Math Faculty Members in the group to: (1) Communicate in advance with the candidate, assessing common research interests and the likelihood that a collaboration would ensue that is fruitful for both the department and the postdoc. (2) Write a proposal concerning possible collaboration. (3) Develop a mentoring plan.\n",

The University of Tennessee at Knoxville is the flagship university in the Tennessee state higher education system. In recent years, the Department of Mathematics has steadily increased its research prominence both within the University and in the larger mathematical community. For example, department faculty give about 200 external invited talks per (non-pandemic) year at locations around the world, many of which are fully or partly funded by the inviting organization or conference.\n",

The downtown area, including the Old City new development on the south side of the Tennessee River, is a thriving mixture of shops, restaurants, breweries, and residential and business buildings. The city’s Urban Wilderness is larger than Central Park in New York City and supports an abundance of activities from water sports to hiking, running and mountain biking on over 50 miles of trails and greenways. The city has a relatively low cost of living, and there is no state income tax on earned income.\n",

       "Candidates should apply via MathJobs.org, including curriculum vitae, description of their research accomplishments and plans, teaching statement, and three or more letters of reference.
